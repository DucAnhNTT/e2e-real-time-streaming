# Real-Time Data Processing and Analytics with Apache Flink, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Docker

## Overview
This project guides you through building an end-to-end data engineering system using Apache Flink, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Docker. The system processes real-time data and generates analytics, demonstrating the power of these technologies in an industry-grade data pipeline.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

JDK 11+
Apache Flink
Kafka
Elasticsearch
Docker and Docker Compose

## Installation
### Clone the Repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using Maven:

bash
```
mvn clean install
```

### Docker Services
Use Docker Compose to set up the required services:

bash
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download necessary Docker images, create containers, and start services in detached mode.

### Verify Services
Check if all services are up and running:

bash
```
docker-compose ps
```
You should see all services listed as 'running'.


### Accessing the Services
Kafka Control Center: http://localhost:9021
Debezium UI: http://localhost:8080
Elasticsearch: Default port 9200

### Shutting Down
To stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes:

bash
```
docker-compose down
```

## Getting Started
Follow the video tutorial for a step-by-step guide on building and running the project.

## Customization
You can modify the Docker Compose file to suit your needs. For example, consider additional configurations for production environments.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This setup is intended for development and testing purposes. For production environments, consider additional factors like security, scalability, and data persistence.
